Proof of Concept: Project CLOUD

CougarLab Online: U Develop (lol idk)

Opportunity:

Cloud technologies have become a dominant paradigm in the computer
science industry. Many developers spend some or all of their time
working on virtual machines accessible anywhere. CLOUD will provide a
similar experience to CSU's undergraduate computer science students,
acclimating them to the new industry standards.

Undergraduate Computer Science students often need to set up new
development environments that are sometimes used just once or twice.
This can be a resource-intensive burden which causes later confusion.

CLOUD will serve as a programming sandbox for students to experiment
with code in a low-stakes environment. Premade images will allow
students to choose the resources they need for a given project, from
machine learning to web development. They'll be able to start projects
quickly, gaining cloud and Linux experience along the way.

Project definition:

Project CLOUD intends to create a private cloud for development use by
CSU computer science students. It will provide students with the
infrastructure to create on-demand development environments.

Project goals:

1.  Work

Project requirements:

1.  Network access

2.
