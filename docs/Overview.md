# Overview
This project is intended to give students and employees access to processing and storage in a secure private cloud. Our goal is to create the cloud from scratch using open-source software, ultimately opening access to students and employees.
## Purpose
Our project is the development of a private cloud for the Columbus State University Computer Science Department. We have been provided with three pre-owned hardware servers with the intent of adding more server power if all goes well. 
## Current Status
All future work past sprint 7 will officially be handed off to the future team. More details will be provided in additional documentation that is outside of the scope of this report. Some of the tasks that will be handed off will include reconfiguration of the internal network, connection of all three nodes, proper installation of OpenStack 2024.2 or newer, and completion of physical setup. Faculty will need to work with UITS over the summer to secure network access via wall ports and purchase the hardware needed to ensure successful continuation of the project. 

## Intended Use Cases
Our documentation efforts have been continuous throughout this project. We have documentation on GitHub for the best practice guidelines on maintaining the network and system security which would include firewall rules and VPN configurations as well as a list of any known issues or challenges that we encounter while setting up the private cloud to allow people ahead of us to maintain, repair, and configure the system. 
## Key Concepts
Install and configure Ubuntu Server and necessary software packages on all servers. Establish VLAN and access Cisco switch CLI for configuration. Install DevStack on the 730 server and use it to create a single-node OpenStack deployment. Install and configure production instances of OpenStack using Kolla-Ansible.Continue progress on the DevStack environment, debugging problems and recording solutions. Finalize OpenStack labs. Properly clean the server room and neatly store all unused cords.

**Kelly Payne** My background is in Education, where I taught for eight years in a private school and then began homeschooling twelve years ago. I needed a change in careers and decided to go into the field of Computer Science. I will graduate spring of 2025 with a bachelors in Computer Science with the focus of software systems. In my software engineering course, I really developed a great interest in neural network programming with ai. My group was responsible for developing a model that would accurately predict whether a patient would develop alzheimer's disease. Our ensemble model containing two neural networks (FNN and MLP) and three machine learning models with an average of 90% for testing accuracy. My coding experience comes from course work and personal projects. The coding languages I have experience in are: Python, Java, Assemble, COBOL, C# in Object Oriented, and C++ in Linux.
