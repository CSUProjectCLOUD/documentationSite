# Installing KVM R710 & 730
=========================

We followed the link to install the KVM for the servers.
[link](https://www.linuxtechi.com/how-to-install-kvm-on-ubuntu-22-04/)

After initializing one of the configurations, the KVM was erased on one
of the servers, so we had to reinstall. There was nothing different that
we did while installing the KVM's to the servers.
