iDRAC6 Verification of Existence and that the settings were correct.

All servers (2- 710's & 1- 730) previously had iDRAC6 downloaded. We did
have to set the appropriate IP addresses, subnet mask, & gateway details
while in static IP address. After this was completed, we set the IP back
to DHCP. We also set up a password for accessing iDRAC for remote
access. After the changes were made, we rebooted the servers to save
changes made in iDRAC configurations. We have more components that will
be worked on in following stories as we look at setting up all the basic
aspects of iDRAC6.
