<p>Kubernetes is open-source Container Management tool that automates container deployment, container scaling, descaling, and container load balancing.</p>
<p>Benefits of using Kubernetes:</p>
<p>Automated deployment and management</p>
<p>Scalability-offers horizontal pod scaling – pods automatically scaled depending on load</p>
<p>High availability- reducing latency issues</p>
<p>Cost-effectiveness</p>
<p>Improved developer productivity</p>
<p>Deploying and Managing Containerized Applications with Kubernetes</p>
<p>Install Kubernetes ad setup Kubernetes cluster – one master and 2 worker nodes in any of the clouds</p>
<p>Know create deployment manifestfile – specify exact number of pods required and the container image and what types of resources are required after completion of writing the manifestfile apply the file using kubectl command.</p>
<p>After creating pods- expose the service to the outside of the – write one more manifestfile which contains service type (LoadBalancer or ClusterIP), ports,and selectors.</p>
<p>Networking – use different types of plugins to increase flexibility.</p>
<p>Kubernetes follows the client-server architecture – master installed on one machine and the node on separate Linux machines. Follows master-slave model—master manages Docker containers across multiple Kubernetes nodes. A master and its controlled nodes(worker nodes) make up a “Kubernetes cluster”.</p>

<p>Kubernetes master is responsible for managing the entire cluster, coordinates all activities inside the cluster, and communicates with worker nodes to keep the Kubernetes and application running.</p>
<p>When Kubernetes is installed, we have 4 primary components of Kubernetes Master that are also installed. Components of the Kubernetes Master: API Server-entry point for all the REST commands used to control cluster (API tool kubectl), Scheduler-service that distributes workload and allocates the pod to the new node, Controller Manager- known as controllers—it is a daemon that runs in a non-terminating loop and is responsible for collecting and sending information to the API server.</p>
<p>Kubernetes Worker Node Components: Kubelet-primary node agent that communicates with master node and executes on each worker node inside the cluster, Kube-Proxy-core networking component inside the Kubernetes cluster-responsible for maintaining entire network configuration, Pods- a group of containers that are deployed together on the same host, Docker- the containerization platform used to package your application and all its dependencies together in the form of containers to make sure your application works in any environment.</p>
<p>Kubernetes is used with hybrid and multi-cloud deployments as well as edge computing –other applications listed these are the ones that stood out for me relating to our project</p>
<p>5 BASIC Steps of Building a Private Cloud:</p>
<p>1 Standardization – software and hardware components used for deploying private cloud</p>
<p>2. Consolidation- trimming down equipment to what you need and decide what is able to be scaled up in the future</p>
<p>3. Virtualization- depends on intended delivery model and design of private cloud (Hyper-V, Xen, or VMware)</p>
<p>4. Automation – modify IT processes to your liking</p>
<p>5. Orchestration – final stage – “self-service” ability to private cloud architecture- two main components – a self-service portal and a service catalog</p>
<p>Kubernetes in the cloud and on bare metal differ</p>
