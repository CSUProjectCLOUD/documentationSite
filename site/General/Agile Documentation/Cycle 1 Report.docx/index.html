<p>Authors: Kelly Payne, Jaden Jefferson</p>
<p>As part of an initiative to create a more secure, accessible, and faster
platform for storing and retrieving data on Columbus State University
main campus grounds, we are designing a private cloud server. A private
cloud is a way for a business to store and manage its data and
applications on a dedicated set of servers, in our case it will be used
for Columbus State University's faculty and students to have their own
secure online storage space.</p>
<p>The creation of this server will bring the campus several benefits that
online cloud companies such as AWS, Azure and others are unable to
deliver. The private cloud will allow more control to determine how data
is managed, bring security benefits such as the ability to avoid the
potential of data being exposed to a third party, and increase
performance allowing faster data upload and download speeds using a
local area network.</p>
<p>The project starting on January 15^th^, 2025, will be ready for
production on April 23^rd^ of the same year. Our solution does not
necessitate the reinvention of the wheel, but we must be meticulous to
ensure that the project lives long after its creation. The official
launch and presentation will take place on April 23^rd^ and April
27^th^, respectively.</p>
<h1 id="project-introduction">Project Introduction</h1>
<p>Author: Kelly Payne, Nick Miller, Carnell Greenfield</p>
<p>Our project is the development of a private cloud for the Columbus State
University Computer Science Department. We have been provided with three
pre-owned hardware servers with the goal of providing a horizontally
scalable and clustered infrastructure. This project is intended to give
students and employees access to processing and storage in a secure
private cloud. Our goal is to create the cloud from scratch using
open-source software to ultimately provide access to university students
and faculty.</p>
<h2 id="previous-development">Previous Development</h2>
<p>The work located below is from Sprint 1 and Sprint 2. Our objective in
these phases was to lay a foundation for the project by installing
essential software, addressing initial challenges, and growing our
understanding of the tasks ahead.</p>
<p>We started by examining the servers we'd been provided with and
recording information about their hardware specifications. We have three
servers: one Dell PowerEdge R730 and two PowerEdge R710s. The R730 is
equipped with an Intel Xeon E5-2660 v3 CPU, 128 GB of DDR4 RAM, and
approximately 22 TB of hard disk storage. Each R710 is equipped with an
Intel Xeon L5630, 48 GB of DDR3 RAM, and approximately 900 GB of hard
disk storage. We used a live Puppy Linux environment to gather hardware
information and bypass a password-locked Windows installation.</p>
<p>Next, we installed Ubuntu Server 24.04 on each server, configuring the
operating system as necessary. Each machine was connected to the LAN in
the process successfully. With Ubuntu Server installed, we continued by
installing relevant software packages like Kubernetes.</p>
<p>As of now, March 2^nd^, we are in Sprint 3. We were able to install
Ubuntu on all three servers and KVM. We did have RAID installation and
configuration, but we are seeing that there are more work items related
to this epic such as disk encryption, iDRAC server profile, hardware
monitoring and virtual media. Another epic from this cycle was getting
an IP address configured for each server and getting LAN up and running.
We still have further jobs related to this epic to do such as server
port-based address allocation and connect the servers to the LAN.</p>
<p>A notable discovery was that the servers maintained their RAID
configurations thanks to the presence of physical RAID controller cards.
This preserved the existing setup and removed the need for a complete
RAID reconfiguration. It also underscored the importance of ensuring
compatibility with RAID management software for future maintenance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the team engaged in an in-depth analysis of OpenStack and
Kubernetes. The documentation produced during this phase included a
comprehensive PowerPoint presentation that detailed the initial findings
and configurations. These records are instrumental for ensuring that
future team members can effectively replicate or enhance the project\'s
progress.</p>
<h2 id="22-intent-this-cycle-intent-this-cycle-list-paragraph">2.2 Intent This Cycle {#intent-this-cycle .list-paragraph}</h2>
<p>Author: Kelly Payne, Jaden Jefferson, Jackson Gray</p>
<p>Sprint 1:</p>
<p>This included downloading and configuring software for each of the three
servers, configuring the wiring for PowerEdge 710 and 730, obtaining
access to the desktop to streamline and speed up deployment, conducting
continuous research, and installing the operation system. However, our
progress was somewhat delayed due to weather related campus closures,
which limited our ability to work on our project, except for research.
Despite the setbacks, we successfully installed Ubuntu Server onto each
server, configured the iDRAC on each server, completed the wiring
configuration for servers.</p>
<p>Sprint 2:</p>
<p>Get a VLAN up and running and access to Cisco switch CLI for further
configuration, get the RAID configured, apply a fresh coat of thermal
paste to CPU heatsinks within the three servers, and get IP address
configured for server network. We were able to configure the RAID to our
needs due to the presence of physical RAID controllers within the
hardware, though setbacks with the network switch did not allow us to
fully create a working LAN.</p>
<p>Sprint 3:</p>
<p>Include comprehensive research on OpenStack and looking into development
tools for it, including MicroStack and DevStack. We hope to fix the
issues we were having with our network switch and finally create a LAN
that we can connect the servers to, allowing for full connection across
all three servers as well as simple remote access and configuration.</p>
<p>We are laying the groundwork for maintenance and future development by
documenting our work and wiring configurations, as well as providing
manuals for servers and networking equipment, so that the next team will
not have such a learning curve.</p>
<h2 id="23-future-work-future-work-list-paragraph">2.3 Future Work  {#future-work .list-paragraph}</h2>
<p>Author: Jackson Gray, Jaden Jefferson</p>
<p>Future cycles will entail the installation and configuration of
OpenStack and Kubernetes. We will be connecting our servers to the
network and enabling remote access through SSH. We will also be
researching and implementing security measures such as firewalls and
access control.</p>
<p>Our documentation efforts will continue. In the next couple of cycles,
we plan to create a more detailed network architecture diagram which
will include all devices and their connections. This will include
information on IP addressing, VLANs, subnetting, and routing protocols
used. We hope by the end of the semester to have documentation for the
best practice guidelines on maintaining the network and system security
which would include firewall rules and VPN configurations as well as a
list of any known issues or challenges that we encounter while setting
up the private cloud to allow people ahead of us to maintain, repair,
and configure the system.</p>

<p>The private cloud will provide compute, networking, and storage services
to meet the organization's requirements. The infrastructure will be
built on a set of two PowerEdge 710 servers and one PowerEdge 730 server
which will be connected to a Cisco LAN switch.</p>
<p>The foundation of our private cloud is three physical servers running
Ubuntu Server. OpenStack will be used for the core cloud services.
OpenStack is a free-and-open-source collection of cloud computing
software, which we will be using to manage computing, storage, and
networking resources and divide them among virtual machines. The
essential OpenStack services will be Keystone for identity management,
Nova for computing, Neutron for networking, Cinder for block storage,
Glance for image management, and Horizon for dashboard. Virtualization
will be managed using KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), a Linux-native
application which divides physical hardware resources into virtual
machines. We will use containerization to further divide those virtual
machines' resources into on-demand, scalable resources for users. A
Kubernetes cluster will manage the containerized resources.</p>

<p><strong>Previous freezes:</strong> Snow and Ice conditions closed campus.</p>
<p><strong>Planned freezes:</strong> Spring Break March 15^th^ to March 22^nd^</p>
<p>With the current work needed by the team, the main location where this
will be carried out is on the university campus on the SCCT 4^th^ floor.
Any breaks or potential hazardous weather will freeze the greatly slow
down the available work for the team to accomplish.</p>
<p>The weather did halt our project for one week during Sprint 1, however
we were able to meet online and discuss plans for the upcoming goals to
be met. We may have a pause in engineering tasks over spring break for a
weeklong period.</p>
<h1 id="risk-mitigation">Risk Mitigation</h1>
<p>There are not many risks that could occur in our setting. The only thing
that might hold up development is if a teammate has a lack of time or
ability to work on a project for a considerable length of time. However,
we mitigate and potentially avoid these risks altogether by looking
ahead at our schedules, planning around them and informing our teammates
ahead of time if we see a potential conflict.</p>
<p>There are low probabilities of hardware failures. We don't really need
to worry about the organization, requirements, or planning risks as the
setting we're in eliminates the possibility of organizational meddling
and isn't too hard on the planning.</p>
<p>Risk Identification:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Research current, general cloud risks, such as security, cost, and
    resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security: Identify vulnerabilities and threats to the cloud
    environment. This may include research as well as testing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost: Ensure that usage of resources like power and networking will
    not become prohibitive by identifying possible changes in costs and
    ways to limit excessive usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources: Once deployed, track whether the current resources meet
    user demand. Identify possibilities for expansion or conservation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data management: Ensure that data on the cloud is backed up and
    secure. Identify potential risks to data integrity. Check physical
    hard drives for problems. Identify candidates for drive upgrades, if
    possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gather information and guidance from other University roles, such as
    the Cybersecurity department.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>

<h1 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h1>
<p>There are a few things we learned in the first cycle. We figured how to
bypass password restrictions for PowerEdge 730 server, which involved
opening the server and switching some pins around which was something
new and intimidating. We also learned how to configure the iDRAC for the
servers and configure the wiring for the PowerEdge R710 &amp; R730.
Additionally, we learned how to download and install Ubuntu using a
flash disk.</p>
<p>In this last cycle we learned how to configure the iDRAC for the servers
and that iDRAC 6 &amp; 7 has much more information than we realized. We also
learned how to download and install Ubuntu on a flash disk and servers,
and not to initialize the RAID as that will cause you to have to
reinstall Ubuntu and KVM again.</p>
