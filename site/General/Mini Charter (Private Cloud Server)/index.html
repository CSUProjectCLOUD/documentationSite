| Columbus State University's      |                                  |
| vision prioritizes student       |                                  |
| success and academic excellence. |                                  |
| By tasking students with the     |                                  |
| design, implementation, and      |                                  |
| maintenance of a private cloud   |                                  |
| for real-life usage by peers,    |                                  |
| this project will provide both   |                                  |
| career-relevant experience and   |                                  |

| Successful execution of the      |                                  |
| project is defined by the        |                                  |
| establishment of a functional    |                                  |
| private cloud from bare metal,   |                                  |
| local servers. The cloud should  |                                  |
| be fully accessible by students  |                                  |
| over the campus LAN and the      |                                  |

| to access virtual computing      |                                  |
| services on-demand, simplifying  |                                  |
| their development process. The   |                                  |

| to continue and expand upon our  |                                  |
| efforts. Clear documentation on  |                                  |

| on-premises cloud platform, the  |                                  |
| project will be faster and less  |                                  |
| expensive than offerings from    |                                  |

| A variety of security measures   |                                  |
| will be taken. The physical      |                                  |
| servers will operate from a      |                                  |
| locked room. Further physical    |                                  |
| security can be achieved with    |                                  |
| the lockable server front        |                                  |
| bezels, and a lockable server    |                                  |
| rack. The servers' storage disks |                                  |
| are encrypted with LUKS (Linux   |                                  |
| Unified Key Setup). Access to    |                                  |
| the cloud will be managed with   |                                  |
| OpenStack Keystone, an           |                                  |
