<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>DevStack is a set of scripts which can be used to quickly set up an OpenStack environment.</p>
<p>A DevStack-based environment is used for testing and development and should <strong>not</strong> be your final cloud’s basis.</p>
<p>DevStack is very useful for testing to see whether your hardware can run OpenStack.</p>
<p>Note that, like the rest of this project, a good understanding of Linux will be invaluable for saving you time, effort, and confusion. <a href="https://linuxupskillchallenge.com/" class="uri">https://linuxupskillchallenge.com/</a> looks like a useful resource for the knowledge you’ll need here. Set up an Ubuntu Server VM and mess with it.</p>
<p>The information in this document is heavily referenced from the official DevStack installation guide: https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/index.html</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Fresh Ubuntu Server 24.04 installation</p></li>
<li><p>Internet connection for server</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>First we’ll add a stack user to run DevStack.</p>
<p>The following commands will create the user, give it executable permissions in all cases, and add it to the list of sudoers.</p>
<p>$ sudo useradd –s /bin/bash -d /opt/stack -m stack</p>
<p>$ sudo chmod +x /opt/stack</p>
<p>$ echo “stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL” | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/stack<br />
$ sudo -u stack –i</p>
<p>Next, we’ll download DevStack by cloning its Git repository.</p>
<p>$ git clone <a href="https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack" class="uri">https://opendev.org/openstack/devstack</a></p>
<p>$ cd devstack</p>
<h3 id="create-a-local.conf">Create a local.conf</h3>
<p>Passwords for the OpenStack installation are stored in the file local.conf. Open the file with your text editor of choice:</p>
<p>$ nano local.conf</p>
<p>Enter the following in the file:</p>
<p>[[local|localrc]]</p>
<p>ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret</p>
<p>DATABASE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD</p>
<p>RABBIT_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD</p>
<p>SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD</p>
<p>Change ‘secret’ in the configuration above to the alphanumeric password of choice. We used 0990. You should use something more secure.</p>
<h3 id="start-the-install">Start the install</h3>
<p>Now, you should be ready to install DevStack.</p>
<p>You should still be in ~/devstack. If not, get there.</p>
<p>Run the following to start the DevStack scripts:</p>
<p>$ ./stack.sh</p>
<p>DevStack will install without further input. Their documentation claims this will take 15-30 minutes. In our experience, the installation could easily take around an hour. Use that time to read up on Linux commands, touch grass, or call your mom.</p>
<h3 id="verification">Verification</h3>
<p>At last, DevStack has executed every last script, and you’ve been handed back control of the server. Time to see if it worked.</p>
<p>First, check if OpenStack is up and running. You will still need to be in the devstack directory.</p>
<p>$ source openrc admin admin</p>
<p>$ openstack user list</p>
<p>$ openstack image list</p>
<p>$ openstack server list</p>
<p>$ openstack service list</p>
<p>$ openstack network list</p>
<h3 id="accessing-dashboard">Accessing Dashboard</h3>
<p>Now, we’ll go to Horizon and try setting up an instance.</p>
<p>Enter the server’s IP address in your browser.</p>
<p>This should bring you to an OpenStack login page.</p>
<p><strong>User:</strong> admin or demo<br />
<strong>Password:</strong> secret defined in local.conf file earlier</p>
<p>Finished</p>
